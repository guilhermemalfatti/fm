The project consists of creating a simple web app with single page experience where the user is able to view
a list of bands and their albums. The comps detailing the specific screens are below, we ask you to follow
those and develop the web app as a mobile-first application, focusing on the design and experience for
mobile screens.

Besides listing, we would also like to be able to search for a specific band and order the list alphabetically or
by popularity.
